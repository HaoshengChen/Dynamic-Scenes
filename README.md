The "Dynamic Scenes" Dataset is provided for testing visual loop closure detection algorithms in highly dynamic scenes. It has strong background in some crucial applications such as autonomous driving system.

This dataset contains two sequences named "Road Ring" and "CBD", respectively.

The entire dataset is recorded by a [ZED](https://github.com/stereolabs) stereo camera at 1280 Ã— 460 resolution @ 60fps.

The loop closure ground truth is formatted as similarity matrix in MAT files.

Note that the "Dynamic Scenes" dataset also can be used for testing localisation or image retrieval algorithms as well.
